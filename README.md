##Project Name: Design and Analysis of Hardwired Control Unit with State Machine
Development: Microsoft Office Toolkit, Google Doc, Simulator
##Aim of the Project: To understand the use of Control Unit and implement Hardwired Control Unit
using State Table Method to find Circuit.
##Objective of the Project: Implement Control Unit Circuit using State Machine Methodology
Covering module in the syllabus for the project:
• Hardwired Control unit
• Logic Gates
• K map
• CPU Design
Abstract: Control Unit is the part of the computer’s central processing unit (CPU), which directs the
operation of the processor. Hardwired Control Unit focuses on the practical circuit approach to
designing a fully functioning Control Unit. In this Project, we sort to find a suitable State Machine to
replicate the workings of an optimized Hardwired Control Unit. For this, we ball park a rough idea for
the State Diagram following an algorithmic flowchart to make the final set of states and transitions. We
then Proceed to Solve the State Tables for the various Variable Flip Flop States in order to conjure the
right circuitry required to simulate the required Hardwired Control Unit (For this, we use Karnaugh
Maps) The Control Unit is considered to be the ‘brain’ of the CPU, as it manages all the functionalities
and time manipulations of various tasks that a CPU handles. Serving such an important purpose for the
CPU, the Control Unit and its quality plays a big role when deciding the status of a given CPU.
