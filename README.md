### AIM: 
To understand the use of Control Unit and implement Hardwired Control Unit using State Table Method to find Circuit. 
### OBJECTIVES:
Implement Control Unit Circuit using State Machine Methodology  
### Abstract:
Control Unit is the part of the computer’s central processing unit (CPU), which directs the operation of the processor. Hardwired Control Unit focuses on the practical circuit approach to designing a fully functioning Control Unit. In this Project, we sort to find a suitable State Machine to replicate the workings of an optimized Hardwired Control Unit. For this, we ball park a rough idea for the State Diagram following an algorithmic flowchart to make the final set of states and transitions. We then Proceed to Solve the State Tables for the various Variable Flip Flop States in order to conjure the right circuitry required to simulate the required Hardwired Control Unit (For this, we use Karnaugh Maps) The Control Unit is considered to be the ‘brain’ of the CPU, as it manages all the functionalities and time manipulations of various tasks that a CPU handles. Serving such an important purpose for the CPU, the Control Unit and its quality plays a big role when deciding the status of a given CPU.
